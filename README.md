# Minimal Production-Ready Deployment Configurations

This project provides a starter template with minimal deployment configurations suitable for production-ready use cases. It includes essential defaults for logging, monitoring, and CI/CD to facilitate a quick and robust setup for your applications on production servers.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to offer a streamlined and opinionated set of configurations that can be easily adapted and extended. It serves as a foundation for deploying services with best practices in mind from the very beginning.

## Features

*   **Production-Ready Templates:** Pre-configured Kubernetes deployment and service templates.
*   **Environment Management:** Structured directories for managing different deployment environments (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `prod`).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrated solutions for observability, including:
    *   EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)
    *   Prometheus & Grafana for metrics and visualization.
    *   Jaeger for distributed tracing.
    *   Loki for log aggregation.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Support for CI/CD pipelines with tools like ArgoCD and Jenkins scripts.
*   **Secrets Management:** Configuration for HashiCorp Vault.
*   **Service Discovery & Networking:** CoreDNS configurations and Istio setup for service mesh capabilities in development environments.
*   **Database Configuration:** Example setup for PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Review Base Configurations:** Familiarize yourself with the configurations in the `base/` directory. These are the foundational templates and settings.
3.  **Customize Environments:** Adapt the configurations in the `environments/` directory for your specific `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` needs. You might use tools like Kustomize to overlay environment-specific changes on top of the base configurations.
4.  **Set up Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster.
    *   Install `kubectl` and configure it to connect to your cluster.
    *   Set up any required tools like Helm, Kustomize, ArgoCD, Vault, Jenkins, etc., as per your deployment strategy.
5.  **Deploy Applications:** Follow the guidelines in `info/add-service.md` to deploy your applications using the provided templates and CI/CD setup.

## Core Components

*   **Kubernetes Manifests:** Located in `base/apps/templates/`, these are the core YAML files for deploying applications.
*   **Monitoring Stack:** Configurations for Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, and EFK are in `base/monitoring/`.
*   **CI/CD:** Jenkins scripts are in `scripts/jenkins/`, and ArgoCD configurations are in `base/tools/argocd/`.
