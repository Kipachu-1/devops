# Jenkins Configuration and Bitbucket Integration

## Jenkins Location

## Configuration
- **General Setup**: Configuring Jenkins is generally straightforward. Follow the official Jenkins documentation for deployment and initial setup relevant to your environment.

  - On the Jenkins side, the Generic Webhook Trigger plugin is highly recommended.
  - This plugin allows you to define flexible rules for triggering jobs based on the payload received from Bitbucket webhooks.
  - Configuration is straightforward and well-documented.
